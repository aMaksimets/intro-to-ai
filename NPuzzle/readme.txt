GBFS		|Greedy Best-first Search


Known Bugs:
 - Error handling is limited, invalid arguments and incorrect puzzle files will cause the program to crash
 - Cannot handle any puzzle larger than an 80-puzzle. This is because coordinates can only be single digit and a 99 puzzle has 10 rows and columns.
   Besides this, an OutOfMemoryException usually occurs when solving a 15-puzzle.

Known limitations:
  - It is very slow. Can you improve it?
  - When it tries to explore the next possible moves, and if all else is being equal, nodes are NOT expanded according to the following order: 
    the agent should try to move the empty cell UP before attempting LEFT, before attempting DOWN, before attempting RIGHT, in that order. 
	Can you fix this issue?
